# Fatter

It's my first game jam ever :D

Keep your stomach alive, don't starve, follow the forks to find the food, (don't eat too much), fart, avoid the malefic broccoli

WASD to move and SPACEBAR to fart.

fill your hunger bar, if it reaches zero or you eat too much you die,

The broccoli can consume your fat by touching you, don't touch them.

You are faster if you are slim, and slower if you are fat, you can fart to loose weight and increase your speed if you are too slow but be careful, you could consume too much weight

BTW: it's trashy
